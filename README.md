# Conky_Tool

Finished basic functions text files. . .
Need to add configuration settings . . .
need to add radio buttons to choose between. . .
conky functions, configuration settings, lua.

Once the config settings and lua options are input . . .
develope a generic special command that will display the 
format of the "special commands". Label "command layout"
entry widget with "command layout" already printed in box
another label with conky definition and explenation. It will
be simple but usable to get by til each of the "special commands"
have their own windows.

gui changes, need to add "new line" button. Remove alignment
box and friends. Need to fix the font menu . . . don't think i
can avoid using another package necessitating an additional
download for the users.
