My email is skytale75@yandex.com, if you have any issues
installing this, please let me know, and paste any output
that may result in the terminal window into the file. I am
confident it will launch.

Current Program Status

finished all the basics

what you will be testing is not the finished product. There
are many more functions to add. This is simply the minimal
I was willing to do before I would allow it to be tested.

The Syntax highlighting is complete. The entire
wiki reference of command definitions is integrated and comes
up automatically as you are scrolling through them. You have
simple control-click functionality. There are very few
keyboard commands in reality, I think 8.

I won't tell you what is to come, first i need to determine
what you like and don't like about my program. Again, this 
is not intended to write your file for you, but make it as
easy as possible for you to write your own file.

Every graphical eliment on the main window has a help file.
All you need to do to open it is press 'Controll + h'.
