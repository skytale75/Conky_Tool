templateN
Define a template for later use inside conky.text segments. Substitute N by a digit between 0 and 9, inclusively. The value of the variable is being inserted into the stuff inside conky.text at the corresponding position, but before some substitutions are applied:
'\n' -> newline
'\\' -> backslash
'\ ' -> space
'\N' -> template argument N (starting from 1)
