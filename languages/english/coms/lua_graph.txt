lua_graph function_name (height),(width) (gradient colour 1) (gradient colour 2) (scale) (-t) (-l)
Executes a Lua function with and draws a graph. Expects result value to be any number, and by default will scale to show the full range. See also 'lua_load' on how to load scripts. Takes the switch '-t' to use a temperature gradient, which makes the gradient values change depending on the amplitude of a particular graph value (try it and see). Conky puts 'conky_' in front of function_name to prevent accidental calls to the wrong function unless you put you place 'conky_' in front of it yourself.
