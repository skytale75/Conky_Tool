image <path to image> (-p x,y) (-s WxH) (-n) (-f interval)
Renders an image from the path specified using Imlib2. Takes 4 optional arguments: a position, a size, a no-cache switch, and a cache flush interval. Changing the x,y position will move the position of the image, and changing the WxH will scale the image. If you specify the no-cache flag (-n), the image will not be cached. Alternately, you can specify the -f int switch to specify a cache flush interval for a particular image. Example: ${image /home/brenden/cheeseburger.jpg -p 20,20 -s 200x200} will render 'cheeseburger.jpg' at (20,20) scaled to 200x200 pixels. Conky does not make any attempt to adjust the position (or any other formatting) of images, they are just rendered as per the arguments passed. The only reason $image is part of the conky.text section, is to allow for runtime modifications, through $execp $lua_parse, or some other method.

<(Utilize Conky)>

see "Add Image" button in the main window. Once you write the path to the image, hit enter, if the path is written properly the size and align fields will automatically fill in. If you change one of the size fields and hit enter, the other field will automatically change value to prevent distortion of the image, if distortion of the image is of no concern, don't hit enter. Once adding the picture, if you change any field and enter submit, the original command you entered will be replaced.
