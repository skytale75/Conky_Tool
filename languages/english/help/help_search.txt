Type a word you want to search for within the commands, and it will return all the commands with that word within it's definition in the Commands window (light blue).

change language (not functional yet)

type: -l "language" (example: -l english)
This will redirect the entire program to get it's definitions and gui element names from that languages folder. As of yet, there is only english.

note

for those interested in translating the program to another language, i have a few tools i am working on to streamline the process as much as possible.

Make Files Editable
-e on (adds a save function to the definitions pop up window)
-e (removes the save function from the definitions pop up menu)
