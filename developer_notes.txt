fixed February 18, 2021

major improvements to color selector box . . .
added color selector tool and colorized buttons to match . . . 
going to apply the same idea tothe main window, one button add
color . . . 

fixed pagify . . . 



fixed yesterday . . . 

added a file check to make sure 2 dollar signs "$$" aren't saved
to the file (crashes out conky) . . . will be adding more checks to make sure the
file is formatted properly, make sure each "{" in the conky.text section is
preceded by a "$".

Eventually set up script to convert from old conky format to new conky format.

Add menu bar, Start Edit, About etc etc. . .


TO DO

new thought . . . on the Manage Colors dialogue . . .
want to add a button at the bottom to import colr schemes in
text format . . . will have to use tkinter file dialogue to
simplify it.

add "remove theme" option from the themes menu (february 19th)

add tooltips

Add radiobuttons to fonts window, "italic, bold . . . "

* find a good color scheme to fix the overall feel of the program . . . 
design some button images . . . consider retooling the entire GUI, put
fonts and colors on tabs in main window, right next to the command/configs . . .
add padding . . . maybe have pagify togge out and in the main file display widow

Add menu bar . . . design icon . . . 

add an option to change font size to the whole program . . . easier to read

change the "Custom" Label to "In Use", and move it under the commands . . . 

each custom color will be placed in a button without text . . . the background
will be the color it represents . . . the default_color will be a label since
you can not add "default_color" in the script.

get rid of the descriptions box, and have tooltips pop up for each highlighted
command.
