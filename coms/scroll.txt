scroll (direction) length (step) (interval) text
Scroll 'text' by 'step' characters to the left or right (set 'direction' to 'left' or 'right' or 'wait') showing 'length' number of characters at the same time. The text may also contain variables. 'step' is optional and defaults to 1 if not set. 'direction' is optional and defaults to left if not set. When direction is 'wait' then text will scroll left and wait for 'interval' itertations at the beginning and end of the text. If a var creates output on multiple lines then the lines are placed behind each other separated with a '|'-sign. If you change the textcolor inside $scroll it will automatically have it's old value back at the end of $scroll. The end and the start of text will be separated by 'length' number of spaces unless direction is 'wait'.
