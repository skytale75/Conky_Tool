execgraph command (height),(width) (gradient color 1) (gradient color 2) (scale) (-t) (-l)
Draws a horizontally scrolling graph with values from 0-100 plotted on the vertical axis. All parameters following the command are optional. Gradient colors can be specified as hexadecimal values with no 0x or # prefix. Use the -t switch to enable a temperature gradient, so that small values are "cold" with color 1 and large values are "hot" with color 2. Without the -t switch, the colors produce a horizontal gradient spanning the width of the graph. The scale parameter defines the maximum value of the graph. Use the -l switch to enable a logarithmic scale, which helps to see small values. The default size for graphs can be controlled via the default_graph_height and default_graph_width config settings.
If you need to execute a command with spaces, you have a couple options: 1) wrap your command in double-quotes, or 2) put your command into a separate file, such as ~/bin/myscript.sh, and use that as your execgraph command. Remember to make your script executable!

In the following example, we set up execgraph to display seconds (0-59) on a graph that is 50px high and 200px wide, using a temperature gradient with colors ranging from red for small values (FF0000) to yellow for large values (FFFF00). We set the scale to 60.

${execgraph ~/seconds.sh 50,200 FF0000 FFFF00 60 -t}
