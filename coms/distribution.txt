distribution
The name of the distribution. It could be that some of the untested distributions will show up wrong or as "unknown", if that's the case post a bug on sourceforge, make sure it contains the name of your distribution, the contents of /proc/version and if there is a file that only exists on your distribution, also add the path of that file in the bug. If there is no such file, please add another way which we can use to identify your distribution.
