lua function_name (function parameters)
Executes a Lua function with given parameters, then prints the returned string. See also 'lua_load' on how to load scripts. Conky puts 'conky_' in front of function_name to prevent accidental calls to the wrong function unless you put you place 'conky_' in front of it yourself.
