tcp_portmon port_begin port_end item (index)
TCP port (both IPv6 and IPv4) monitor for specified local ports. Port numbers must be in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:
count Total number of connections in the range
rip Remote ip address
rhost Remote host name
rport Remote port number
rservice Remote service name from /etc/services
lip Local ip address
lhost Local host name
lport Local port number
lservice Local service name from /etc/services

The connection index provides you with access to each connection in the port monitor. The monitor will return information for index values from 0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are simply ignored. For the "count" item, the connection index must be omitted. It is required for all other items.

Examples:

${tcp_portmon 6881 6999 count} Displays the number of connections in the bittorrent port range
${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0} Displays the remote host ip of the first sshd connection
${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 9} Displays the remote host ip of the tenth sshd connection
${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0} Displays the remote host name of the first connection on a privileged port
${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4} Displays the remote host port of the fifth connection on a privileged port
${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14} Displays the local service name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports

Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a single port range for different items and different indexes all use the same monitor internally. In other words, the program avoids creating redundant monitors.
