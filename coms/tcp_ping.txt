tcp_ping host (port)
Displays the number of microseconds it takes to get a reply on a ping to to tcp 'port' on 'host'. 'port' is optional and has 80 as default. This works on both open and closed ports, just make sure that the port is not behind a firewall or you will get 'down' as answer. It's best to test a closed port instead of an open port, you will get a quicker response.
