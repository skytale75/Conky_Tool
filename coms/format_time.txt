format_time seconds format
Format time given in seconds. This var only works when the times_in_seconds configuration setting is on. Format is a string that should start and end with a "-char. The "-chars are not part of the output, \w,\d,\h,\m,\s,\(,\) and \\ are replaced by weeks,days,hours,minutes,seconds,(,) and \. If you leave out a unit, it's value will be expressed in the highest unit lower than the one left out. Text between ()-chars will not be visible if a replaced unit in this text is 0. If seconds is a decimal number then you can see the numbers behind the point by using \S followed by a number that specifies the amount of digits behind the point that you want to see (maximum 9). You can also place a 'x' behind \S so you have all digits behind the point and no trailing zero's. (also maximum 9).
