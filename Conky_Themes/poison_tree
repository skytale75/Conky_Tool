${alignc}${font Deja Vu Serif:size=20}A Poison Tree${font1}

${alignc}${voffset -12}BY ${color4}WILLIAM BLAKE${color2}

${voffset 10}${alignc}I was ${voffset -6}${font Deja Vu Serif:size=15}angry${font Deja Vu Serif:size=10} with my friend; 
${alignc}I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
${alignc}I was angry with my foe: 
${alignc}I told it not, my ${color3}wrath${color2} did grow. 

${alignc}And I waterd it in fears,
${alignc}Night & morning with my tears: 
${alignc}And I sunned it with smiles,
${alignc}And with soft deceitful wiles. 

${alignc}And it grew both day and night. 
${alignc}Till it bore an apple bright. 
${alignc}And my foe beheld it shine,
${alignc}And he knew that it was mine. 

${alignc}And into my garden stole, 
${alignc}When the night had veild the pole; 
${alignc}In the morning glad I see; 
${alignc}My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
